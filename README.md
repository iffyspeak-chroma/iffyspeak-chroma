- Hey it's me.
- I program stuff. Mostly in Java and C# but I can do a very tiny bit of Python too
- I'm a student learning computer science. This account is not for computer science though. This is to post a haven for my projects that are completely unrelated

## TODO:
- [ ] Create a full plugin that actually does something useful.
- [ ] Become the perfect programmer
